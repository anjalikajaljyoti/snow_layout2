                <h1>description About hills</h1>
                <p>A hill is a piece of land that rises higher than everything surrounding it. It looks like a little bump in the Earth. Since they are higher than everything around them, hills are good places to get a nice view.

                    Hills are easier to climb than mountains. They are less steep and not as high. But, like a mountain, a hill will usually have an obvious summit, which is its highest point. </p>
